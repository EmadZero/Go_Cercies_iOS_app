### Inspiration

Right now there is heavy talk on social media about the new grocery prices compared to previous years, so we wanted to see if there was an actual difference and if there was just how much of a difference there was. 

### What it does
It allows users to pick a city, and then be shown the current price, old price, and percent increase or decrease in the item to inform them on the trends going on currently in the grocery market.
